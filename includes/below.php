## Help and feedback

Create an issue on the [GitHub site](https://github.com/QMCPACK/pseudopotentiallibrary/issues) or contact the developers of the potential you are interested in.

## Contributing

Contributions of potentials developed for high-accuracy many-body and quantum chemical techniques are welcomed. We will give full attribution and links to published papers, relevant source codes, more extensive datasets etc. 
If you have a dataset, please create a pull request on the [GitHub site](https://github.com/QMCPACK/pseudopotentiallibrary/pulls) from a forked and branched copy of the repo. [Create an issue](https://github.com/QMCPACK/pseudopotentiallibrary/issues) for help with this or to discuss a contribution. 

## Roadmap

* We plan to gradually fill out the periodic table, focusing on elements needed for topical materials and molecules.
* Additional elements will be prioritized and added based on requests. Create an issue or email us if you need an element.
